# Explorations with Julia
Learning [Julia](https://julialang.org/) through a mix of tutorials and documentation. [Half of what I code is meaningless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZip_br_v3w)

This is an attempt to learn the language that is Julia. [Julia Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) <br>
I hope to keep updating it as I go through the process, a lot of the content is from the official Julia tutorials and the official documentation. I will also compile resources I find here. 

Cheers
